# ndsu3lib

`ndsu3lib` is a Fortran library for calculation of SU(3)-SU(2)xU(1) reduced coupling coefficients, SU(3)-SO(3) reduced coupling coefficients, and SU(3) recoupling coefficients, namely U, Z, and 9-(lambda,mu) coefficients.

A simple program `ndsu3lib_example` demonstrating usage of the library is provided.

C++ wrappers of Fortran subroutines are provided. The C++ functions are in the file `ndsu3lib.h` along with interface documentation.
A simple program `ndsu3lib_example_cpp` demonstrating usage of the C++ wrappers is provided.

For installation instructions see `INSTALL.md`.
